    <p>An earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale struck Assam’s Morigaon district early Monday morning. According to 
        a report by the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), the tremor struck Assam at 4 am. However, it did not result in 
        any loss of life or damage to property.</p>
    <p>The NCS report further revealed that the epicentre of the earthquake was located at a latitude of 26.37° North and a 
        longitude of 92.29° East. It also had a depth of 50 kilometres.</p>
    <p>The quake was felt across several parts of central Assam, including Morigaon and nearby districts like Kamrup Metropolitan, 
        Nagaon, East Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong, Hojai, Dima Hasao, Golaghat, and Jorhat. Sources suggest that the state's capital, 
        Guwahati, also felt the tremor. Several reports also suggest that parts of West Bengal and northeastern states also felt 
        the tremor. Neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan also experienced the quake.</p>
    <p>Although no casualties have been reported so far, the quake caused panic among the inhabitants, and many of them rushed 
        out of their homes.</p>
