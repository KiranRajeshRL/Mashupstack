    <p>Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh said that the company aims to double the number of its mobile 
        devices with Al features powered by Google's Gemini in 
        2026. By 2025, the South Korean firm had rolled out 
        Gemini-backed Al features to about 400 million mobile 
        products, including smartphones and tablets. It now 
        plans to boost that figure to 800 million in the current year. 
        "We will apply Al to all products, all functions, and 
        all services as quickly as possible," Roh told news 
        agency Reuters in his first interview since becoming the company's co-CEO in November. With the move, 
        Samsung seeks to reclaim its lost crown from Apple in the smartphone market, the report says. It also aims to 
        fend off competition from Chinese rivals not only in mobile telephones, but televisions and home appliances, all 
        overseen by Roh.</p>

    <p>Roh said that other than search, consumers o frequently use a range of generative Al editing and productivity 
        tools for images and others, as well as translation and summary features on smartphones.</p>

    <p>As per the report, Roh expects the adoption of Al to accelerate, as Samsung's surveys on awareness of its Galaxy 
        Al brand jumped to a level of 80% from about 30% in just one year. "Even though the Al technology might seem a 
        bit doubtful right now, within six months to a year, these technologies will become more widespread," he said.</p>
