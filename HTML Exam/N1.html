    <p>Following his capture by U.S. forces on January 3, 2026, deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro is scheduled 
        for his initial court appearance in Manhattan federal court at noon on January 5, 2026.</p> 
    <p>The proceedings, overseen by U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, will formally notify Maduro and his wife, 
        Cilia Flores, of multiple federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, 
        and weapons offenses. U.S. prosecutors allege that Maduro led the "Cartel of the Suns," a state-sponsored network 
        that facilitated the trafficking of tons of cocaine into the United States for over two decades.</p> 
    <p>Captured during "Operation Absolute Resolve"—a surprise predawn military raid on his Caracas residence—Maduro was 
        transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. While President Donald Trump has asserted that the U.S. is 
        now "in charge" of Venezuela until a transition is established, Maduro’s legal team is expected to challenge the 
        arrest's legality, arguing he retains sovereign immunity as a head of state. The capture has drawn varied international 
        reactions, with the UN Security Council convening to discuss the potential violation of Venezuelan sovereignty. </p>
